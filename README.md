## 📖 Project Description

**RBrickks Property Listing App** is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse, post, and manage rental properties. It is designed using modern technologies like **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend, with **MySQL** as the database and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication.

The application supports user registration and login, viewing property listings, filtering by city/type/rent, and adding or deleting properties for authenticated users. The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs built with Spring Boot, and handles authentication tokens for protected routes.
